# ITSC 1213: Project 3

## Part A: Order Tracking (15 points)

In this section you will be altering the execution of your FastFoodKitchen such that rather
than using a fixed order list when run, the orders will be created by parsing through an
external file at execution time.

Once your orders are populated, the program should proceed as before. When the day ends (i.e., user selects exit),
the following should happen:

- An end of day report should be generated as a text file
    - This file should include what orders were placed and whether they were completed or not. The file should also
      include totals for each item sold (number of hamburgers, number of cheeseburgers,...). You can include any other
      information you think is relevant.
- An updated orders file. This file should follow the same format of the input file , but have any orders that remain to
  be completed. This file should have a slightly different name, such as burgerOrders2.csv.

### Point distribution

- orders loaded from file (5 points)
- end of day report (5 points)
- updated orders file (5 points)

## Part B: Changing the Test Harness (5 points)

The other change weâ€™ll be making to the project is a potentially small alteration to the test harness code. Our goal
with these changes is to alter the flow of the test harness such that the execution of your program represents one run
of our fast food kitchen being executed. The most important aspect of this is the idea of a starting orders (the orders
available at the start of the execution) and an ending orders (completed orders removed).

Update the test harness to reflect the updates made to orders such that before the program exits the end of day report
and updated orders file are generated.

## Part C: Handle Exceptions (7 points)

There is a lot of user input using the scanner class in this project. Usage of the scanner class can lead to lots of
different exceptions being thrown (i.e., What if the user enters a letter when you are expecting a number? or the other
way around?). There is also the use of the File I/O classes and methods when the read from and write to files. You
should catch these exceptions in the program and write out an error message.

1. Catch `InputMismatchException` when you ask the user for a number using `nextInt()` or `nextDouble()`.
2. Catch general `Exception` in a try block around all scanner input calls, as a way to check for the many possible
   errors that can occur when asking the user for input.
3. Catch `FileNotFoundException` when you have open/close file operations
4. Catch `IOException`

## Coding Style (3 points)

- Appropriate prompts and informative output
- Appropriate method, variable and object names
- Proper indentation
- Good commenting (explains what code is doing)
- Well-organized, elegant solution

## Extra Credit

- Add in one additional function as described in Programming Checkpoint 2
- A scanner which asks the user to enter the inventory filename (allows you to progress day to day)
- Institute a daily sale! One way to do this would be to randomly select one item to receive a discount. How this
  affects sales and revenues should be noted in the end of day report.
